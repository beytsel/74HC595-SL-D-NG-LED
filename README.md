74HC595 SLİDİNG LED

The 74HC595 Shift register IC is a shift register that provides parallel reception of serial input data. By storing the serial data in D type flip-flop, it provides parallel output in the desired state. 74HC595 ICs can be connected to each other in a cascade manner thanks to its 9th pin. It is generally used in light show applications. It can be easily controlled by Arduino or any other microprocessor.
